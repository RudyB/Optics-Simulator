# Physics Concepts

### Circular Hole Diffraction: 

For a circular aperture, interference occurs between all rays from the whole area producing a series of concentric fringes. The exact solution in this case is difficult but turns out to be of the same form as for a slit (d ‚àô sinŒ∏ = ùëö Œª) except that m is non-integer (i.e. m = 1.22, 2.23, 3.24, 4.24, 5.24. . .) and d is the diameter of the hole. The interference fringes produced by diffraction of laser light by a circular aperture is showed below:

The intensity pattern for a circular hole diffraction, known as the Airy pattern, looks like:

where Œ≤ = ùúãùê∑sinŒ∏ /Œª and J1 is a Bessel function of the first kind of order unity, whose value are tabulated as follows:

**Combine interference (2-slit) with diffraction (finite-width slit):** When the aperture consists of two finite slits, each of width D, separated by a distance d, then the intensity pattern is a combination of both the single-slit pattern and the double slit pattern: the amplitude of the two slit interference pattern is modulated by a single slit diffraction pattern, as shown below.

The intensity diffraction pattern for a double-slit looks like:

In this full pattern, the finely spaced interference maxima (from the double-slit) are spaced ŒîŒ∏ = Œª/d apart, while the more widely spaced minima of the single-slit diffraction pattern are separated by ŒîŒ∏ = Œª/D (except for the first 2 minima whose separation is 2Œª/D)

### Diffraction Grating: 
The diffraction grating is an optical component used to spatially separate polychromatic light (white light) into its constituent optical frequencies. Diffraction gratings are used in such diverse fields as spectroscopy, colorimetry, metrology and laser optics.

A large number of parallel, closely spaced slits constitutes a diffraction grating, characterized by the spacing d. G = 1/d is the slit frequency or slit density, more commonly called "lines per millimeter".

The condition for maximum intensity is known as the grating equation, same as [1]: 

d‚àôsinŒ∏=ùëöŒª, ùëö=1,2,3...

However, angular separation of the maxima is generally much greater because the slit spacing is so small for a diffraction grating. The intensity maximum is very sharp and narrow, providing the high resolution for spectroscopic applications. The peak intensities are also much higher for the grating than for the double slit
